# PyTorchFundamentals

A hands-on PyTorch script exploring essential operations such as reshaping, masking, unsqueezing, tensor-to-numpy conversion, one-hot encoding, and probability selection with `gather`. Useful for beginners and intermediate developers looking to understand tensor behavior and indexing tricks.

File:
- torch_examples.py â€” Core script demonstrating PyTorch fundamentals

Topics covered:
- Tensor creation and reshaping: `reshape`, `view`, `unsqueeze`, `squeeze`
- Numpy to torch conversion
- One-hot encoding using `np.eye`
- Probability gathering using `torch.gather`
- Masking and indexing logic for tensor manipulation

Install with command:
```bash
pip install torch numpy
