# PyTorchFundamentals

A collection of foundational examples and code snippets to help understand and practice core PyTorch concepts. Topics include tensors, autograd, model building, training loops, and optimizers.

Files:
- tensors.py — Basic tensor operations  
- autograd_demo.py — Gradient tracking and backward pass  
- simple_nn.py — Basic feedforward neural network  
- optimizer_examples.py — Common optimizer usage  
- training_loop.py — Manual and high-level training workflows

Install with command: pip install torch numpy

Run files individually using:
```bash
python filename.py
